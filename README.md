# Test task

_Stack_: node.js, express.js, React.js, mySQL. CRUD app.

This is what I could done in 7 hours (~3.5 hours, 2 days):

- **API** for the MySQL server (`/api` folder)
- **node.js** backend (all `.js` files in the root folder)
- **Admin page prototype** (`/admin` folder)
- **React client page** (`/public` folder)
- **SQL example dump** (`/sql_backup` folder)

I've used _yarn_ as the node package manager.

Thank you for the task!

I think the task is quite **typical** (what 90% of devs usually have to do). Nevertheless, it is challenging and it could improve your skills in FullStack applications!
I would rather give 3-4 days (or ~14 hours) to do this task 100% completed (because of bunch of issues in modern frameworks, etc).
Some **strange** and **unobvious** things are shown in comments. But I am ready to explain them!
